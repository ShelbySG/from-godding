###### My favorite restaurant is Steak N' Shake

I love it because the shakes are superb and the burgers are always great. The shoestring fries are my **favorite**. Though I will say they have recently gotten rid of waiters and made everything kiosk based. It's like a Freddy's now. **I don't like that.**
